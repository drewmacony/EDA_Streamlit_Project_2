## Overview
This platform is designed to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry by utilizing advanced machine learning models. It helps companies identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services, allowing them to take proactive measures to improve retention, satisfaction, and revenue. 

## Features

### Predictive Analytics
- **Real-Time Churn Prediction**: Assigns a churn probability to each customer based on their behavioral and demographic data.
- **Behavioral Pattern Detection**: Identifies key behaviors that suggest a higher risk of churn.
- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Highlights factors contributing to the likelihood of churn.
- **Trend Analysis**: Examines historical trends to forecast future customer behaviors.
- **Automated Alerts**: Notifies relevant teams when churn risk exceeds a predefined threshold.

### Visualization Tools
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing data and churn predictions.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Visualizes different customer groups based on behavioral and demographic data.
- **Trend Graphs**: Displays historical churn rates and trends.
- **Feature Importance**: Highlights key predictors influencing churn predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes ROC and PR curves to evaluate model effectiveness.
